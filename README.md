# SHIFTY	
For those who have a job with changing shifts, who wants to keep track of their working hours via telegram

Just send the date, begin and end time of your work and it will be saved : 

    you : +20/01 11h00 14h00 16h30 22h00
    bot : 8.5 hours

Don't remeber ? 

    you : ?20/01
    bot : Saturday 20/1 : 
	      11:0-14:0
	      16:30-22:0
	      8.5 hour

Made an error  ? erase the day with 

    you : -20/01
    bot : 2001 removed


## TODO
I want it to be able to give the total of working hours per week, and per month. 
maybe some type of graphical calendar of working days to be send via photo  ?
